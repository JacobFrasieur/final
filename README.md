# final
# Before you grade:
# We put in hours of work and did our best, if it fails to meet standards please be aware of the following:
# 1) We can only communicate and work digitally given the coronavirus epidemic
# 2) The hecticness that occured due to the virus has made our time on this assignment sporadic, though plentiful
# 3) We had to learn a lot from the internet, so if any code we use looks funky or isnt quite working know that we did our best and put our hearts into this incomplete mess, even with losts of class being cancelled we tried learning what we could from the internet
# 4) I messaged you about using pygames but never got a response back, I wanted to make sure you knew that given that being worth 20% of the grade for this assignment
# Before you run:
# The file order for the resources is important, moving them around will break it
